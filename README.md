![leafspy][leafspyimg]

## Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `leafspy`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/leafspy/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Leaf Spy"

Using your HA configuration directory (folder) as a starting point you should now also have this:

```text
custom_components/leafspy/translations/en.json
custom_components/leafspy/__init__.py
custom_components/leafspy/config_flow.py
custom_components/leafspy/const.py
custom_components/leafspy/device_tracker.py
custom_components/leafspy/manifest.json
custom_components/leafspy/strings.json
```

## Configuration is done in the UI

### Android app configuration

Open the Leaf Spy app, go to `Menu` -> `Settings` and scroll down to `Server`. 
Change the following settings:
- `Enable`: Yes
- `Send Interval` can be whatever you prefer.
- `ID`: `<Car Name>`
- `PW`: secret generated when the integration was installed
- `Http` or `Https` depending on the access to your Home Assistant install.
- `URL`: webhook url generated when the integration was installed 
  - Note: **Do not** add http or https to the URL.
